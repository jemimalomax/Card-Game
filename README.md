# Card-Game

A project for a programming based university paper. It simulates a card dealing game. A person has a specified number of cards and may deal them and then pick them up based on a variety of specifications - for example, from left to right top to bottom (which is one of the specifications for picking up row-wise), top to bottom left to right (which is one of the specifications for picking up column-wise) and so on. The rows/columns can be of any length, but must be of the same length. Several methods initialise the deck, count transformations, and so on. There are also support methods that are used within larger ones. The deck can be initialised by a custom set of cards read in from stdin, or a default of the numbers 1 to n (n can be set by the user). One challenge encountered was with the transform() method, which had to fit within a certain number of lines. To deal with this, I had the idea of using recursion along with a method to reverse an array, after noting that some specifications were simply mirrors of one another, which cut it in half. Finally, in the main method, the user can give several arguments on the command line that denote exactly which action/information they would like from the deck.
